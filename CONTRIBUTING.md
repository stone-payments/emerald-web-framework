## Commiting

We use [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to automatically manage component versions and generate Changelogs. Semantic Release analyzes commit messages in the CI environment to determine:

* which components have changed since the last release;
* which version each changed component should have;
* what changes should be written to the Changelogs.

As [explained in the documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format), commit messages starting with `fix`, `feat`, `perf` or `BREAKING CHANGE` will update the versions and the Changelogs of each component altered by a commit. Some [prefixes do not trigger actions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type), like: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style` and `test`.
